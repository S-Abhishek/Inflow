        - Return the "actual" time he takes to complete the task
        - Repeat the same thing for about 20 tasks or more
            - Thereafter, each time the user gets an input for the "estimated time", suggest an "approximate time" that he would actually take to complete the task.
            - This would be based on the previous similar "estimated time" that the user has given
            - This would improve his time-management abilities and enable him to give a more "close-to-reality" estimated time.
            - However, if his "estimated-time" is close to the the "time-to-be-suggested", then no suggestions would be provided.
                - This could be implemented using ML/AI?
    - Push notifications so that the user doesn't miss deadlines
    - Auto-scheduling of tasks
        - Based on prority as well as
        - Based on "estimated-time" entered by the user to complete a task
            - Or if more than 20 tasks have surpassed, base it on "estimated-time" as well as "the previous actual time taken based on previous estimated time"
    - Include statistical analysis of missed/accomplished deadlines/events/estimated time vs actual time taken/no completed and no ongoing etc.
- Event countdowns
